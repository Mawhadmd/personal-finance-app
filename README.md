# Personal-Finance-app

Once complete, the app will be using Docker, PostgreSQL, Next.js, Expo, Recharts, JOSE, Motion, Maybe Stripe, and Tailwind. It will be operating on both mobile and web. 

## How I built it

Docker -> PostgreSQL -> Next.js Development (Api Routes and FrontEND) -> Expo (Using Next.js Api routes) (SOON) -> Integrate Stripe (Possible)

## Why I built it
I built this app because I will probably be using it personally and will add a new functionality once in a while. I may also announce it to the public and start receiving real traffic once it's completely done. Nevertheless, this app has already taught/strengthened me so many things, including Docker, ORMs, SQL, Advance Auth, and more.

## How to run it

## Requirements
- Docker Desktop
Coming Soon
